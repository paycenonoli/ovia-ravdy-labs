# CI/CD Pipeline Project on AWS

This project demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline setup using various DevOps tools and technologies. The goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment of a microservice application on AWS, leveraging GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, JFrog Artifactory, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Prometheus, Grafana, Terraform, and Ansible.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **CI/CD Orchestration**: Jenkins
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Code Quality Analysis**: SonarQube
- **Artifact Repository**: JFrog Artifactory
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Kubernetes Package Manager**: Helm
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS

## Architecture Overview

1. **Source Code Management**:
   - The source code is maintained in a GitHub repository.

2. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Jenkins is used for CI with a master-slave configuration.
   - Jenkins pulls the code from GitHub and uses Maven to build it into a `jar/war/ear` file.
   - Post-build, SonarQube performs code quality analysis.
   - If the analysis is successful, the artifact is stored in JFrog Artifactory.

3. **Containerization**:
   - Docker is used to containerize the application.
   - The Docker image is also stored in JFrog Artifactory.

4. **Continuous Deployment**:
   - Ansible is used to deploy the Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Prometheus and Grafana monitor the Kubernetes environment.

5. **Infrastructure Provisioning and Configuration**:
   - Terraform provisions the infrastructure on AWS.
   - Ansible is used for configuration management.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- GitHub account
- Jenkins server set up with master-slave configuration
- Maven installed
- SonarQube server
- JFrog Artifactory instance
- Docker installed
- Kubernetes cluster (EKS on AWS)
- Helm installed
- Prometheus and Grafana set up
- Terraform installed
- Ansible installed

## Setup Instructions

1. Configure AWS credentials and initialize Terraform.
2. Create the infrastructure using Terraform scripts
   
# Configuration Management with Ansible
1. Use Ansible to configure Jenkins, set up slave nodes, and configure Kubernetes.

# Jenkins Pipeline Setup
1. Configure a Jenkins pipeline to pull the code from GitHub, build using Maven, run SonarQube analysis, and push the artifact to JFrog Artifactory.
2. Add a post-build step to create a Docker image and push it to JFrog Artifactory.
3. Add a deployment step using Ansible to deploy the Docker image to the Kubernetes cluster.

# Monitoring Setup
1. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Kubernetes cluster.
2. Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize the metrics.

## Conclusion

This CI/CD pipeline automates the entire process from code commit to deployment, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow. By using a combination of powerful tools, we achieve continuous integration, continuous deployment, and robust monitoring for our microservices application on AWS.

## Future Improvements
- Implement automated rollback strategies.
- Enhance security measures, such as using AWS Secrets Manager for managing secrets.
- Set up alerting mechanisms with Prometheus Alertmanager and Grafana notifications.
